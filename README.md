# RemplissageBddSoundisen
Retrieves music &amp; albums of an artist via Spotify API, downloads music from YouTube &amp; saves in artist-named folder.    
Also searches for album/single covers, descriptions &amp; artist's info.    
Formats the results for integration into a database for the "soundisen" project.   

To use this script you need to create a file named "key.py", in the same directory, wich must contain : 
```
#Your spotify api key
spotify_key = "Your_key"
spotify_secret_key = "Your_secret_ket"
```
